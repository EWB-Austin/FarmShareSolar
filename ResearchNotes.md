# Research Notes

## Our panel

We have an BP1370N model. http://greenforcesolar.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BP3170N.pdf

This produces 170 Watts at 35 volts.


## Valuable referneces

This explains an approach to similar to what we need:
http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-OFF-GRID-SOLAR-SYSTEM/?ALLSTEPS

* We should probably use a solar battery (a lead-acid battery designed for this purpose.)
* We should almost certainly use a 12 Volt system overall.
* Our system uses MC4 connectors.
* We probably want to count on bulbs like this: http://www.amazon.com/Bulbs-White-Round-Equivalent-Powered/dp/B00STM70OA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442093567&sr=8-1&keywords=12+Volt+LED+light+bulb
* There are lots of 12V fans available, they are relatively small, many use a cigarette lighter adapter: http://www.amazon.com/Portable-Fan-Can-Batteries-Adapter/dp/B001APXO5C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1442093746&sr=8-2&keywords=large+12V+fan
* We need to investigate how likely theft is in this environment
* We need to design a folding fan of some kind.
* We probably need to lay underground conduit.
* We probably need to have an electrician inspect this stuff.
