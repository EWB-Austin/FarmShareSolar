# Research Notes

## Our panel

We have an BP1370N model. http://greenforcesolar.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BP3170N.pdf

This produces 170 Watts at 35 volts.


## Valuable referneces

This explains an approach to similar to what we need:
http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-OFF-GRID-SOLAR-SYSTEM/?ALLSTEPS

* We should probably use a solar battery (a lead-acid battery designed for this purpose.)
* We should almost certainly use a 12 Volt system overall.
* Our system uses MC4 connectors.
* We probably want to count on bulbs like this: http://www.amazon.com/Bulbs-White-Round-Equivalent-Powered/dp/B00STM70OA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442093567&sr=8-1&keywords=12+Volt+LED+light+bulb
* There are lots of 12V fans available, they are relatively small, many use a cigarette lighter adapter: http://www.amazon.com/Portable-Fan-Can-Batteries-Adapter/dp/B001APXO5C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1442093746&sr=8-2&keywords=large+12V+fan
* We need to investigate how likely theft is in this environment
* We need to design a folding fan of some kind.
* We probably need to lay underground conduit.
* We probably need to have an electrician inspect this stuff.
* 

## Some back-of the envelope calcutaitons

Daily Load: Light at 11 Watths for 3 hours 
Fan: 50 W x 8 Hours 

Total ~= 450 Watt Hours

Battery (12 Volts) requireed 450/ 12 = 37.5 Amp hours, so get 40 A hour battery.

Example battery: http://www.amazon.com/VMAX-MB86-50-Replacement-Scooter-Upgrades/dp/B00BJBCZV6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442094654&sr=8-1&keywords=12V+battery+deep+cycle+40AH
 $140 
 

Basic circuit power = 170W/ 12 volts ~= 15 Amps

So we need a 15 amp charge controller.

This is a possibility, again $150: http://www.amazon.com/Tektrum-Solar-Panel-Charge-Controller/dp/B004GBWJ44

However, our panel has an open-circuit voltage of 44.3 V --- that may be a problem for that controller.  I don't fully understand this.

This charge controller claims to work with High-voltage panels, but is $225 http://www.solar-electric.com/mosumpsochco.html
